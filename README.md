CSS Slider
=====================

This is a mainly CSS based modern image and text slider – hardware accellerated by default. Written by [Anselm Hannemann](https://twitter.com/helloanselm).

Contents
--------

CSS Slider consists of a little set of files with minimal markup. I wanted to keep everything plain and simple, so you we have everything in one file except the images:

	index.html

This file contains a section for CSS where you will find a normalize/reset part followed by the actual slider's CSS. On bottom of the page you'll find some JavaScript which is helpful to keep a smooth working slider.
